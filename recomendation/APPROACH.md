# Hybrid Recommendation System Approach

### Collaborative Filtering

- **Model:** Matrix factorization using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD).
- **Training:** Utilize the Surprise library to train the collaborative filtering model on the user-item interaction matrix.
- **Output:** Learn latent factors for users and items based on their interactions.

### Content-Based Filtering

- **Features:** 'movie_genres' will be used as content information.
- **Representation:** Convert textual genres into numerical vectors using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency).
- **Scaling:** Standardize the TF-IDF features to ensure consistent scales.

### Hybrid Model Integration

- **Combination:** Combine the outputs from collaborative and content-based models.
- **Integration:** Train a final hybrid model (e.g., neural network) using the combined features to predict user ratings.

## Implementation Steps

2. **Collaborative Filtering:**
   - Train SVD model using Surprise library.

3. **Content-Based Filtering:**
   - Convert 'movie_genres' to TF-IDF features.
   - Standardize TF-IDF features.

4. **Model Integration:**
   - Combine collaborative and content-based features.
   - Train the final hybrid model.

5. **Evaluation:**
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
   - Evaluate the hybrid model using metrics like RMSE.

6. **Hyperparameter Tuning:**
   - Fine-tune hyperparameters based on evaluation results.

7. **Prediction:**
   - Use the trained hybrid model for real-time recommendations.

8. **Deployment:**
   - We will not deploy the model since this is just a POC

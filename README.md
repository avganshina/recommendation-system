## Overview

This document outlines a personal project showcasing a recommendation system inspired by industry-leading platforms. The project aims to replicate the recommendation system used by prominent online marketplaces.

## Key Components

### 1. Collaborative Filtering

Collaborative filtering allows users to discover products that align with the preferences of similar users.

### 2. Content-Based Filtering

In addition to collaborative filtering, the system incorporates content-based filtering. This approach involves analyzing the features and characteristics of items listed on the platform. By understanding the attributes of musical instruments and gear, the system suggests items that match the user's preferences based on item attributes, such as genre, and specifications.

## Conclusion

The recommendation system aims to create a tailored and engaging experience. By combining collaborative and content-based filtering, we strive to assist users in discovering the perfect movie.
